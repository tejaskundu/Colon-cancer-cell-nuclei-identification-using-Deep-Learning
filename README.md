# Colon-cancer-cell-nuclei-identification-using-Deep-Learning
A ConvNet that can predict the cell type of the images of colon cancer nuclei. The approach is to build a simple ConvNet, perform unsupervised pre-training by training an autoencoder on the unlabelled test image data and then use the 'encoder' section (with trained weights) as a feature extractor for the first part of your ConvNet.
